GeoPin is an android application built by Federico Girlanda, Andrea Turchet and Francesco Pasti for the 2020 course "Programming Embedded Devices" 
of Professor Fantozzi from the University of Padova

Just the apk is relased in the directory to protect sensitive data.

The idea behind the application is to put pins with a title and a comment on the world map with a caviat: You can only place them if the GPS of your device is
actually in that location!

Here are some screenshot to have a rough idea of how's the app
